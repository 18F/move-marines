# Shipping Firearms Safely
### Ship your Privately Owned Firearms (POF) legally and efficiently

## What should I know?
Moving with a POF can be complicated. The laws and regulations vary widely between and within states, and especially between countries. It is your responsibility to understand the requirements for legal transfer of a POF from one place to another. When moving a POF:
* Start early.
* Determine transport method.
* Gather paperwork.
* Complete forms/applications.
* Prep for the move.
* Execute the move.

### Start Early
Do not wait until the last minute if you have a POF that you intend to move. You will need time to research requirements and determine the method of transport that works best for you. Additionally, some POFs require special permits, registration, and/or government approval. These administrative matters can take up to six weeks or more to complete. Improper shipment of POFs can result in confiscation and/or fines.

### Determine Transport Method
The following are the main ways to transport your POF to your new duty station:
* Household Goods (HHG) Shipment
    * If you intend to ship your POF as counseling process. If you self-counsel, identify that you intend to move a POF in the comments section of the shipment application.
    * If you do not notify your moving company that you intend to include one or more POFs in your shipment, they reserve the right to refuse to pack the POFs.

* Hand Carry: You can travel with your POFs via car/truck or commercial air. See below for further instructions.
* Partial Personally Procured Move (PPM)
    * Self-Shipment: You may ship a POF to yourself in the care of another person in your destination state. Address the package to yourself “in care of” the out-of-State resident. See the link to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) FAQ at the end of this handout for further guidance.
− The United States Postal Service (USPS) and other mail services will ship your POFs for you. It is your responsibility to follow all of their packaging, shipping, and sending regulations. Note that the USPS will not ship handguns.
    * Federal Firearms License (FFL) Transfer: You can have the holder of an FFL transfer your POF(s) to another FFL holder in your destination state for a fee (usually around $25). You will also be responsible for any shipping costs. These shipments comply with all federal, state, and local laws, and offer you the option of insuring the shipment against loss and damage.

### Gather Paperwork
Build a folder containing any receipts, current permits, and any other paperwork applicable to your POF(s).
###  Research Requirements
Verify that the POF(s) you intend to move are legal in your destination state or country. For outside the continental United States (OCONUS) moves, identify countryspecific requirements by consulting the Personal Property Consignment Instruction Guide (PPCIG). The PPCIG link is in the list at the end of this handout.
For continental United States (CONUS) moves, consult the laws and regulations of your destination state. ATF provides a summary of the laws of all U.S. states and territories. If you intend to travel with your POF(s), you should also consult the laws and regulations of the states you will cross on the way.
### Complete Forms/Applications
Some states require POF owners to register with the police or state authorities. Other states require a permit to possess a POF. If either of these policies are in place in your destination state, it is a good idea to fill out the paperwork in advance if possible.
Additionally, certain types of weapons are restricted under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The ATF regulates these POFs, and you must comply with ATF rules when moving a POF restricted under the NFA. Finally, if you are moving back to the U.S. from OCONUS, you must complete ATF Form 6 in advance. Allow at least six weeks for processing.

### Prep for the Move
If you are shipping your POF as part of your household goods:
* Make the POF inoperable by removing the bolt, firing pin, trigger assembly, and other arming parts.
* Remove all ammunition from the POF. If you intend to travel with your POF(s):
* Obtain a hard-sided case.
* Remove all ammunition from the POF.
* Place the POF in the case.
* Lock the case.
* Place the locked case in the trunk of the vehicle (if applicable).
If you intend to ship your POF separately from your HHG:
* Obtain permission from your local Personal Property Office (PPO) to execute a partial PPM.
* Apply for an Advance Operating Allowance (if needed).
* Gather required shipping materials.
* Pack your POF(s) per shipper guidelines.
* Ship POFs via FFL transfer, UPS, FedEx, DHL, or USPS as applicable.
* Save all receipts for reimbursement at destination.
### Execute the Move
You are now ready to execute the move. Follow these tips for success:
* Hand carry all paperwork related to your POF(s), including shipment paperwork.
* If travelling via car/truck, keep all POFs locked in and in the trunk of the vehicle.
