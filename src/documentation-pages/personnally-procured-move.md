# Conducting a Personally Procured Move
### Helping you plan and prepare for your Personally Procured Move (PPM)

## Plan
### Am I eligible?
* Any service member or deceased service member’s next of kin is eligible for incentive payment.
* Civilians who execute a PPM are eligible only for reimbursement.

### How can I move my household goods?
* Partial PPM
    * A combination of a government arranged
move and a PPM.
* Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs)/Trailers
    * Use your POV with/without your own trailer to complete the move
* Rental Vehicles.
    * Rent a vehicle to transport your household
goods (HHG).
* You-Load They-Drive
    * Hire a commercial carrier to drive the loaded goods from one location to the next.
* Selective Commercial Services
    * Choose to hire packing, loading,
transporting, storage, unloading, and unpacking services from various commercial carriers, agents, or companies.

### How much am I allowed to bring?
You may move up to the weight allowance determined by your orders, grade/rank/rating, and dependent status. To avoid paying extra, use the Weight Estimator tool found on move.mil under Tools & Resources.

### How much do I get paid?
* The government will pay you an incentive equal to 95% of the government’s costs to move your goods.
* Remember: the incentive payment depends on the actual weight moved and is not a full reimbursement.
* Planning is key to ensuring your costs do not exceed your incentive payment because choosing more expensive moving companies and services may result in costs that are higher than your incentive will cover.

## Organize
### How do I get approval?
* Attend a counseling session at your local Personal Property Office (PPO).
*  Obtain a DD Form 2278 signed by your PPO.
### What are my responsibilities?
* Obtain necessary equipment, materials, and vehicles to transport all property in a safe manner.
* Locate weigh scales for full and empty weight tickets.
* Obtain certified and legible full and empty weight tickets.
* Submit a final PPM claim with all required supporting documentation within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Advance Operating Allowance (AOA), when applicable.
* Maintain copies of all contracts, receipts, and a settled copy of the claims package for at least seven years (for tax purposes).
### What are operating expenses?
* Expenses required to complete your move such as rental vehicles/trailers, packing materials, moving equipment, blanket wraps, gasoline, tolls, cost for weight tickets, etc.
* Calculate your tax liability by subtracting your documented costs from your total incentive payment (Tax Liability = Incentive – Costs).
* The incentive payment refunds the operating expenses up to 95% of the government’s costs.

### What is an Advance Operating Allowance?
* An AOA is an advance payment of up to 60% of the government’s costs that you can use to defray up-front move costs.
* If your final incentive payment is less than your AOA, you will owe the government money.
* Anaccurateweightestimatemakesthis
much less likely, and is required for you to
receive an AOA.
* To receive your AOA payment, turn in DD Form
2278 and other required documents to the local disbursing office.
### Do I need insurance?
Insurance is highly recommended. The most common need for extra insurance is if your car insurance does not cover trailers pulled behind your car. The government will not reimburse the cost of buying extra insurance.
### What if I need to store my items?
You are responsible for booking your own storage- in-transit (SIT). The maximum reimbursable time limit for SIT is 90 days. Options for SIT include extended vehicle rental time, commercial warehouses, and SIT warehouses. Make every effort to avoid storage, as it can quickly result in excess cost.

## Execute
### What is a weight ticket and what are weight ticket requirements?
* A weight ticket is a certificate stating the weight of a vehicle and is usually machine printed.
* You must obtain empty and full weight tickets for each load at installation weigh scales (preferred). When those scales are not available, you can obtain weight tickets at origin, destination or any location between the origin and destination.
* Tickets must be produced by a certified scale and must be legible.
    * All on-base scales are certified.
* No passengers can be in the vehicle when weighing vehicles.
* If you are towing a POV behind a rental vehicle, the POV must be detached while obtaining weight tickets.
* Locate weigh scales at https://www.move.mil.

### What should I do with my receipts?
Save all of your authorized expenses receipts from your move. If a receipt is not legible or descriptive you should write the amount/description to the side. You must initial next to any pen changes.

### Anything else I should consider while moving?
Keep DD Form 1351-2 updated throughout your move.

## Closeout
### What if something is lost or damaged?
Generally, the government will not pay claims for lost or damaged items because you are responsible for everything in a PPM. For a claim to be accepted it must be proven that the damage was out of your control. For example, your truck was rear-ended by a drunk driver.
### How do I submit my settlement?
Take your claim to a USMC PPO where they will review your claim, scan it in, and send it to the right office. If you do not have access to a USMC PPO or other-service equivalent, mail or email your completed paperwork to Transportation Voucher Certification Branch (TVCB).
### When will I get paid?
* Transportation Voucher Certification Branch (TVCB) works claims on a first come first served basis. They keep their website up to date with the submit date for the claims they are currently working on. Once TVCB posts that they are working on the date your claim was received, allow 10-15 days before contacting the office for a status update.
* To know exactly when TVCB received your settlement, send it through United States Postal Service (USPS) and request a return receipt. Turn “read-receipt” on for emailed packages.
