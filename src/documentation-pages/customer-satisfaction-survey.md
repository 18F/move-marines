# Customer Satisfaction Survey
### Help us make sure only qualified companies support our members

## What is the CSS?
The Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) is a vital tool for helping us make sure only the best moving companies pack, store, and move your household goods. The CSS is important because it determines 70% of a company’s Best Value (BV) Score. The BV Score, in turn, regulates how much business a moving company can get from the U.S. Government.

## Why should I complete the CSS?
Our goal is 100% participation in the CSS. By completing this survey, you will help ensure only the best companies support your future moves and those of your fellow service members.

## How is the CSS structured?
The CSS is quick and easy to compete, and includes:
Personnel from Headquarters Marine Corps review CSS comments and can use the CSS to hold moving companies accountable through warnings or suspensions.

* 7 questions to rate your moving company’s timeliness and professionalism in packing, pickup and delivery
* Open comments sections where you can provide clarification on responses
* Fields for entering your contact information (so that we can contact you directly to resolve identified moving company issues)
* A request to be contacted or not to be contacted.
