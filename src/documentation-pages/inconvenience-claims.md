# Inconvenience Claims
### Recoup unplanned expenses when your TSP misses scheduled dates

## What is an inconvenience claim?
If your moving company cannot meet agreed-upon dates, they may cause a serious inconvenience and unplanned out- of-pocket expenses. An inconvenience claim allows you to recoup unplanned expenses such as lodging, meals, and household items. However, the maximum liability for lodging and meals cannot exceed established per diem rates.

## When can I submit a claim?
You may submit a claim if your Transportation Service Provider (TSP) misses any of the following as indicated on the Government Bill of Lading:
* Pick-up date
* Delivery date
* Required Delivery Date
* Delivery date out of storage.
Contact your company’s customer service section or Personal Property Office (PPO) for additional information and assistance with submission of inconvenience claims.

> ### Remember, TSP is not an entitlement program. Contact your moving company prior to making purchases.

## What is the claim process?
* Contact your TSP before buying anything. 
* Save all receipts and submit your claim directly to your TSP’s claims department.
* Your TSP will acknowledge receipt within 7 days and pay approved reimbursements within 30 days.

## Are there exceptions?
Personnel on temporary living allowances are not allowed to file inconvenience claims. Generally, events that are out of the control of the moving company are also exempt, such as:
* Natural disasters
* Acts of the public enemy or mob
interference
* Acts of the Government or the public authority.

## What expenses can I claim?
You are eligible to claim reasonable out-of- pocket expenses that relate directly to relieving a definite hardship including:
* Lodging and meals (if not in residence)
* Laundry Service
* Kitchen and household items (towels, bedding, pots, pans, paper plates, napkins and disposable cutlery)
* Rental furniture (beds, cribs, sofa, table, chairs, appliances, and one TV).

## What items are excluded?
Any expense or item not supported by an itemized receipt is excluded from an inconvenience claim. Other exclusions include:
* Cleaning supplies
* Toiletries and cosmetics
* Military attire or personal clothing
* Dry cleaning
* School supplies
* Alcohol or pharmaceuticals
* Expenses that occur before the delivery date or out of the local area.
