# Unaccompanied Baggage
### Plan and prepare for shipping your Unaccompanied Baggage (UB)

## What is UB?
* UB is part of your weight allowance that ships separately from household goods (HHG), usually via expedited means.
* Generally, UB consists of the essentials that you want to arrive first or that you want to keep later than HHG.
* Shipments under 1,000 pounds may travel via commercial air.

## How should you use UB?
Time the shipment of your UB based on your specific circumstances. For example, it may be harder to find essentials overseas.
* When leaving the United States, it is usually helpful to send your UB as early as possible to minimize your wait time for your essentials at your destination. The items you send will help you while you wait for your HHG to arrive.
* When returning to the United States, it may be better to send your UB as late as possible to allow you to send your HHG sooner. This strategy minimizes wait time on your full HHG when you return to the states and allows you to use your essentials overseas longer.

## Who qualifies for UB?
* UB is approved for outside the continental United States (OCONUS) Permanent Change of Station (PCS) moves and Temporary Duty (TDY) moves by exception only
