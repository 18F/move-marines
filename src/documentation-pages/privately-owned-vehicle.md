# Shipping or Storing Your Privately Owned Vehicle
### Plan and prepare for Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) movement or storage

## Who can ship a POV?
You can ship your POV if you are a Department of Defense member or employee who is completing a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to or from outside the continental United States (OCONUS), provided:
* Your host country allows import of your POV, and the POV meets all basic host country requirements (see the Personal Property Consignment Instruction Guide (PPCIG) Country Instructions);
* Your orders do not otherwise restrict shipment; and
* You possess an authority to ship (from your Personal Property Office (PPO));
* POV storage is authorized ONLY when shipment is prohibited (either by military order or host nation regulation).
Check with your local Personal Property Office or consult the Defense Travel Regulations (DTR) Part IV, Attachment K-3 for additional information.

## What qualifies as a POV?
* Any motor vehicle owned by, or on a long-term lease (12 or more months) to a customer or their dependent to provide personal transportation that:
    * Is self-propelled;
    * Is licensed to travel on the public highways;
    * Is designed to carry passengers or household goods; and
    * Has four or more wheels; or, is a motorcycle or moped (applicable if you do not ship a vehicle with four or more wheels on the same authorization or order).
The DTR lists additional restrictions in Part IV, Attachment K-3.

## When to ship your POV?
Consult your PPO as to the most appropriate time to ship your POV. The PPO will direct you to the nearest Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) for turn-in. Travel time for your POV varies by destination, but plan to be without your vehicle for at least six weeks. Service policies dictate when you must ship the vehicle and what you need to get an exception approved.

## What can you ship in your POV?
* Vehicle tools, not to exceed $200 in value * Items such as jacks, tire irons, tire chains,
fire extinguishers, nonflammable tire inflators, first aid kits, jumper cables, and warning triangle/trouble lights
* One spare tire and two snow tires with wheels (either mounted or un-mounted)
* Portable cribs, children’s car seats, and strollers
* Luggage racks and supports
* Small items such as thermos bottles, bottle warmers, and car cushions will be packed for transportation by the VPC
* Speakers and audio/video equipment in POV or trunk must be bolted down or permanently fixed as part of the POV
* Catalytic converters, catalyst components (pellets), oxygen sensors, or pipe segments used to replace converters in overseas areas.

## Key requirements for POV turn-in
* Valid set of orders/amendments
* Written approval from leasing or lien-
holder authorizing export
* Government/State issued identification
* Proof of vehicle ownership (title or registration)
* No unresolved Recall Notices
* Fuel at 1⁄4 tank or less
* Department of Transportation and
Environmental Protection Agency sticker attached in the original position (for import into the US)
* A complete set of keys, to include gas cap and wheel locks (valet keys are not accepted)
* Installed auto alarm or anti-theft devices turned off or disconnected
* POV is clean and in a safe and operable condition
* POV meets host nation emission control and safety standards (listed in the PPCIG).

## Tips
* Plan to be without your vehicle for approximately six weeks. It may make sense to turn-in the vehicle early to minimize inconvenience at your destination (or vice versa).
* Verify that vehicle description codes annotated on turn-in paperwork are accurate (failure to do so may prevent claim settlement in your favor if your vehicle is damaged).
* Retain a duplicate set of keys.
* Provide accurate and up-to-date contact information so the VPC can notify you when your vehicle is ready for pickup.
* Do not schedule drop-off on the way to the airport. Allow at least 6 hours for drop-off.

## Top reasons for turn-in delays
* Too much fuel
* Vehicle not clean per standards
* Documentation not complete
* Late for appointment
* Recall not corrected
* PPCIG requirements not checked.

## Picking up your POV at destination/from storage
Contact the VPC for official confirmation that the POV is on-hand and available for pick up. When you or your designated agent pick up your POV at the destination VPC, you must have:
* Proper Government/State issued identification;
* Your copy of the DD Form 788 or VPC provided commercial equivalent of the DD Form 788;
* Complete set of keys;
* If using an agent, a certified Power of
Attorney or letter of authorization; and
* A valid US street address to clear US Customs (when shipping from OCONUS to continental United States (CONUS)).

## When picking up your POV
* Carefully inspect the exterior and interior to determine if there is any new damage;
* Ensure items left in the POV at origin are still there; and
* Carefully and completely list any loss and or damage to your POV on your vehicle shipping document, DD Form 788, or commercial equivalent.
