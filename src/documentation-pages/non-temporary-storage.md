# Non-Temporary Storage (NTS)

Non-temporary storage (NTS) is long-term storage of your belongings used generally instead of shipping your items to your new duty station. Expect the storage location to be located near the origin (pickup) location where items may remain for the duration of your tour. When you return and have established a new address, you can request retrieval and shipment of your stored belongings.

There may be restrictions on CONUS NTS, so be sure to contact your [local personal property office](https://move.mil/resources/locator-maps) if you have any questions.
