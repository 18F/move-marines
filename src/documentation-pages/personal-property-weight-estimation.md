# Personal Property Weight Estimation
### Estimate the weight of your personal property

## Why do I have to estimate my weight?
An accurate weight estimate is the key to a successful move. It will save you time, money, and stress. Not only does it help you identify how much stuff you are moving before you pack, but it:
* Helps match the right Transportation Service Provider (TSP) to your shipment;
* Determines the number of days required for packing;
* Helps your TSP come prepared the first time;
* Gives you an idea of what you need to do to avoid responsibility for excess costs; and
* Provides a baseline for your Personally Procured Move (PPM) Advance Operating Allowance.

## How do I estimate my weight?
1. Go to the online
weight estimator tool. https://www.move.mil/resources/weight-estimator
2. Fill in information for the items that you plan to ship as completely as possible.
3. When you are finished, click “Calculate my Estimate”. There are two important pieces of information from the output of the tool.
* The Grand Total
* This is the total for your shipment and should be BELOW your weight allowance.
* Average Pack Time
* This is the estimated time
required for your TSPs to pack your property before pickup. Plan your move accordingly.
4. Print and save your estimate for future reference.

## Tips
* Have you moved before? Use your previous move weight as a starting point and add any heavy items you’ve acquired in the time since.
* Need a quick estimate? You can approximate by multiplying the number of rooms you have (excluding bathrooms) by 1,000 pounds.
* Are you planning multiple shipments? Complete a separate weight estimate for each (household goods, unaccompanied baggage, non-temporary storage, etc.) and make sure the sum of all estimates is less than your weight allowance.
* Not sure how to classify your property? Your TSP will review your estimates as part of the pre-move survey.
* Near or over your weight allowance? Donate or throw away unneeded items in advance to avoid being charged excess costs. Request a reweigh if you’re still close.
* How will we check your actual weight? Your TSP (or you if performing a PPM) is required to get full and empty weight tickets at your origin destination and a full weight ticket at the destination.
