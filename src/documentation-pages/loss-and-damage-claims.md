# Loss & Damage Claims
### Resolve loss & damage claims to your Household Goods (HHG) and property

## Know Your Rights!
If any of your HHG are lost or damaged during the move process, you are entitled to full replacement value of that item.
* This means that the moving company should pay to repair or replace any lost or damaged property with a like item.
* The Transportation Service Provider (TSP) will require proof of the item's value and quality and will likely want evidence of the replacement cost.

## Loss/damage at delivery
Follow the key steps below for documenting loss/damage of household goods at delivery.
1. Inspect all items;
2. Note any obvious loss and/or damages and ask the driver to complete and sign a Loss & Damage Report (DD Form 1840);
3. Acknowledge receipt of all high value items; and
4. Reviewinventoriesandotherforms before signing.
Your TSP may offer you up to $500 on the day you move in, called a “quick claim.” Be careful in your negotiation and only accept if you agree with the offer − you cannot file a claim again on the same items.

## What if my moving company damages my residence?
If your TSP causes damage to your home or residence, you should contact your moving company directly and arrange for the damage to be fixed. Residential damage is not covered under Defense Personal Property Program. To document proof of damage:
* Take photos or video of your residence prior to arrival of packers;
* Note damage on inventory or delivery forms; and
* Call your Personal Property Office (PPO) for assistance.
If you have any problems negotiating settlement, you should contact your local legal office and seek assistance from a Legal Assistance Attorney. If you are not entitled to military legal services, you should consult with a local attorney.

> ###  Remember ... this is a negotiation, so if you are not happy with an offer, you should reject it.
 

## What if I disagree with the moving company?
You may transfer any part of your loss or damage claim to your Military Claims Office (MCO) after claim submission through DPS. The MCO does not handle claims for residence damage. Once you make the transfer in Defense Personal Property System (DPS), the MCO will contact you if they need any additional information.
* The MCO pays depreciated value plus any money they recoup from the company, but the process is usually slower.
* Send as much documentation as you can to help the MCO recoup your money from the moving company.
* Do not feel pressured to take the moving company’s offer if you can prove your property value- let the MCO help you.

## What information do I need to file an itemized claim?
Even after you submit a Loss & Damage Report, you must submit an itemized claim in DPS for every item that was lost or damaged during the moving process. Gather the following information before logging into DPS to submit a claim:
* Manufacturer;
* Briefdescriptionofitem;
* Inventoryitemnumber;
* Cost at purchase and year of purchase;
* Description of damage;
* Proof of value or condition (optional);
* Repair estimate (optional); and
* Photos & receipts (if available).

## Tips
* Submit a Loss & Damage Report within 75 days of delivery to let your moving company know you plan to file a claim. This step will give you an extra 6 months to file your claim.
* Check the inventory sheet for accuracy;
* Document everything completely;
* For high value items:
* keep all receipts;
* get appraisal records; and
* take photos or videos prior to packing, with enough detail to show condition (show electronics on and working).

> ### Remember ... a Loss/Damage Report is NOT a claim. You must still file an itemized claim in DPS to receive reimbursement!
