# Marine Specific Moving Information


# Moving Resources

There is valuable Passenger Transportation and Personal Property information on the Logistics Distribution Policy Branch Permanent Change of Station (PCS) webpage. Please click the image icons below for information on moving your family, pet, vehicle and more! All U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) service members and civilian personnel can find additional information on executing a PCS move at www.move.mil. Early coordination and communication are key to ensuring a successful PCS. 

## Information on Pets

The key to a successful PCS with pets is early planning, constant action and consistent dialogue between the Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC), Distribution Management Office (DMO) and you. Know the rules and deadlines for moving your pets well in advance of your move. Shipping your pet is a benefit, not an entitlement- which places pet transportation responsibility directly upon you.
Check with your local DMO well in advance of travel to ascertain the number of available Pet spaces per
flight. Pet spaces on the AMC-PE are both limited and reserved on a "first come, first served" basis for
all DoD Uniformed Service Members and DoD Civilians alike. Accordingly, submit your port call request
to DMO as soon as possible, thereby, allowing the DMO to make all necessary AMC-PE reservations NLT
90-days prior to your scheduled date of departure. 

PCS orders with appropriation data are NOT required to make reservations in GATES, or to secure pet spaces on the AMC-PE since the latter is a personal expense. Remember, continue to monitor your pet travel status up to the scheduled date of departure and let us know via email: usmcpassengertravel@usmc.mil, if you have any questions.
